<ol>
  <li>
    <p>This server is sensitive to people’s identities, whatever form they may take, and as such comments that are racist, homophobic, transphobic, etc. will not be tolerated. This means that the use of slurs is not permitted and is a bannable offense.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Furthermore, promoting harmful ideologies including but not limited to white supremacy, Nazism, etc. This also applies to violence, mass murder, genocide, etc. It is perfectly fine to discuss these things but please do not promote it. For example, someone discussing their interest or liking to authoritarian dictatorship type governments is fine but it is not okay to promote something such as Nazism or anything along those lines.</li>
  <li>
    <p>This server is intended to be inclusive of and respectful towards marginalized groups, e.g. LGBTQIA+ folks, racial/ethnic minorities, neurodivergent folks, people with mental illness and/or disabilities, non-native English speakers, immigrants, etc. so please do not use language that is disparaging towards such folks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Please keep all NSFW content in to the NSFW channel, we won’t get up your ass for a stupid sex joke, but do please keep all kink conversation and NSFW pictures/content to its channel.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Please try your hardest to keep conversation on topic pertaining to the correct channel. ᴇxᴀᴍᴘʟᴇ- Please do not talk about sensitive content such as self harm in the general chat, we try to keep each channel with a certain energy to respect other individuals and their own energy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Please do not perform any energy work, readings, spells, etc on someone without consent. If this happens, it will result in an automatic ban and will not be tolerated.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Respect the DO NOT DM/ASK TO DM ROLES. We have these for a specific reason, please try to keep this in mind before dming someone. Also, if we are told of harassment/sexual content towards minors in DMs or our server, it will result in direct consequences.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Respect each other. This has many many meanings. Please respect one another’s beliefs no matter what they may be, it is fine to discuss or debate it. Although if you are asked to stop do stop. This goes for all situations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are having an issue please let us know by dming a mod. We care about our members and if an issue comes up we will deal with it immediately.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No excessive pinging. Enough said.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Respect our mods please. It is our job and we need to keep the server organized and healthy. Although, if you have any issues with a mod feel free to message another mod you are comfortable with.</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="tc underline">Additional Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>mod note that deity experiences range drastically! While it’s okay to share both good and bad experiences, and give your opinions: its not so okay to imply or state that your experiences are the only correct/real/or valid ones! Do not argue that someone should not worship who they worship please!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Please note that some users are utilizing tupperware bot!  its a bot that allows to other personalities, spirits, and general headmates speak without being confused with the host by putting a mask on their profile– So note that conversations with users with “bot” next to their name are NOT bots unless you’re in a bot channel. :heart: Thank you!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tupperware users will show up with a ? as their icon picture, and “bot” next to their name. They are NOT bots, but, for example, a tulpa or other such being utilizing the bot. Bullying nonhumans is just as not acceptable as bullying humans. We welcome everyone on this server– humans and nonhumans alike!</p>
  </li>
