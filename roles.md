To gain access to the main part of the server, you will need to request the {% include atoms/roles/text.html text="!r!497610586750976020!r!" %} role from a {% include atoms/roles/text.html text="!r!499037360340598819!r!" %} member in the {% include atoms/roles/text.html text="!c!role-request!c!" %} channel.

In that channel you may also optionally self-assign a number of roles, listed out below. The roles that can be self-assigned have **clickable green buttons** which, when pressed, will copy the role assignment command to your system clipboard so that you can easily paste it in the channel.

**Please only paste and send one command at a time**. The bot does not know how to parse more than one command per message.

{% include molecules/roles/note.html text="Example: `n.iam <@&504966239765135360>` would *assign* you to the !r!504966239765135360!r! role." %}

To unassign a self-assigned role, use the same command but replace `n.iam` with `n.iamn`.

{% include molecules/roles/note.html text="Example: `n.iamn <@&504966239765135360>` would *unassign* you from the !r!504966239765135360!r! role." %}

When you get the opportunity, please also **leave a quick introduction** in the {% include atoms/roles/text.html text="!c!introduction!c!" %} channel. In addition to learning more about you and your practice, **we'd also like to know how you found us**!
