* mod note that deity experiences range drastically! While it's okay to share both good and bad experiences, and give your opinions: its not so okay to imply or state that your experiences are the only correct/real/or valid ones! Do not argue that someone should not worship who they worship please!

* Please note that some users are utilizing tupperware bot!  its a bot that allows to other personalities, spirits, and general headmates speak without being confused with the host by putting a mask on their profile-- So note that conversations with users with "bot" next to their name are NOT bots unless you're in a bot channel. :heart: Thank you!

* Tupperware users will show up with a ? as their icon picture, and "bot" next to their name. They are NOT bots, but, for example, a tulpa or other such being utilizing the bot.
