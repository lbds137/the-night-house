Although we strive to foster an environment where conversations can flow freely with minimal interference, we are a publicly accessible forum, and hence it is necessary to establish some ground rules / standards of conduct for the protection and comfort of our members. These rules also help streamline moderation of the server, such that everyone is on the same page about what is and is not permitted. **The primary theme of our rules is *“respect each other”*, in every sense of the word “respect”.**

*Please note that by joining the server you consent to being within the protection of the server’s spiritual wards.* The wards **_do not_** interact with any member’s energy or energy system nor intrude upon or probe them. They filter the energy that attaches to the server and guard the space from harmful outside entities, energy that attempts to harm the server or its members, and anything else that similarly threatens the server’s security.

1. **You must comply with the [Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and the [Discord Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines).** *Violations may result in immediate removal from the server, depending on severity.*

2. **You may not promote violent or discriminatory ideologies.** This includes (but is not limited to) things such as white supremacy, Nazism, mass murder, genocide, etc. _Note: it is acceptable to **discuss** these things (in the appropriate channel) provided that you do not express **support for** or **affinity with** them._

3. **You may not insult or belittle someone on the basis of their identity.** This includes the use of language that insults an individual for their membership in a protected class / marginalized group, such as slurs (with *narrow* exemptions for **(1)** slurs targeting a majority / privileged group and **(2)** reclaimed slurs if they are used to describe *yourself*).

4. **You may not harass other server members, via direct message or otherwise.** You are expected to respect DM preference roles and also **refrain from sending friend requests without permission**. If a server member asks you to stop messaging them, you are expected to honor their request or else risk facing disciplinary consequences. Furthermore, **you must refrain from sending explicit content of any kind to other members in DMs without prior authorization** (this includes unsolicited sexual advances or visual content).

5. **You are expected to conduct yourself respectfully within the server.** In particular, you should avoid disparaging another member’s beliefs or engaging in ad hominem attacks. While you may share your own experiences and opinions, you should avoid implying that your experiences are the only “real” / correct / valid ones.

6. **You are expected to be mindful of users who are utilizing the PluralKit bot.** It allows for other personalities, spirits, or headmates to differentiate themselves when speaking through someone’s physical body. You can tell the difference between PluralKit proxies and regular server bots by checking the name color – the server bots appear as ***gray***, whereas proxies appear as ***white***. If you are a PluralKit user, **you must utilize a system tag** so that your proxies can be easily associated with your main account for moderation purposes.

7. **You are expected to make a reasonable effort to stay on topic.** The server is organized by topic / interest, so you should move conversations to the appropriate channel when it makes sense to do so. _In particular, conversations of a **sensitive** or **NSFW** nature, e.g. describing mental health challenges or self-harm ideation, or discussions of sex and / or drugs, should be constrained to the appropriate channels. **Please note that NSFW channels require an opt-in access role.**_

8. **You may not spam.** The Night House is not a platform for spreading questionable “messages” or dumping useless content without engaging with the main subject of the server, which is occultism. This is naturally a subjective matter that will be dealt with according to the discretion of the staff, but generally you should balance your quantity of “shitposting” with quality discussion of occult topics. *If you are copy-pasting the same questionable content on several servers, then you are likely breaking this rule and will be dealt with accordingly.*

9. **You may not offer unsolicited medical advice or attempt to diagnose anyone with a condition.** It is permissible to share links and resources or suggest that someone see a qualified professional, but for liability reasons this is not a space to engage in any sort of formal diagnostic activities. *Furthermore, the occult is not a replacement for proper medical care, and making any claim that a condition can be cured through spirituality alone will lead to disciplinary consequences.*

10. **You are expected to follow the directions of the server staff and refrain from “mini-modding”.** Respectful disagreement is expected from time to time, but extensively arguing with server staff over moderation issues will likely land you in trouble. _Note: staff members may have personal opinions that they are allowed to express freely without speaking officially for the server. **If you are not sure what constitutes personal opinion and what constitutes official policy, you should ask for clarification.**_

11. **You may not block staff members.** Staff members may need to interact with you at times in order to perform their duty of moderating the server. If you have an issue with a particular staff member, please reach out to *any other* member of the staff, who will work to address the issue confidentially to the best of their ability. **If you are discovered to have blocked a staff member, you will be removed from the server immediately.**

12. **You are expected to use the ticket system for server-related inquiries / reports that require privacy.** Staff members may not always be available to answer DMs or may choose to keep their DMs for personal use only. Furthermore, the ticket system allows staff to keep records of official interactions so that a paper trail exists in the event that an issue needs to be revisited in the future.

13. **You do not have an irrevocable right to be in the server.** If you are consistently causing disruption or otherwise harming the community with your behavior, you may be removed from the server. We will make reasonable attempts to resolve issues amicably and involving some degree of due process, but we reserve the right to remove problematic individuals at our discretion.
