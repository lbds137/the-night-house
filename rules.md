Although we strive to foster an environment where conversations can flow freely, given that we are a (semi-)public forum it is necessary to establish some ground rules / standards of conduct for the protection and comfort of our members. The primary theme of our rules is "**respect each other**", in every sense of the word "respect".

---

1. **Do not promote harmful / violent ideologies**. This rule refers to (but is not limited to) things such as white supremacy, Nazism, mass murder, genocide, etc. *Note: it is OK to discuss these things (in the appropriate channel) provided that you do not express support for or affinity with them*. 

2. **Do not use offensive slurs that target people's identities**. This server is sensitive to people's identities, whatever form they may take, and as such comments that are racist, homophobic, transphobic, etc. will not be tolerated.

3. **Do not insult or belittle someone on the basis of their identity**. This server is intended to be inclusive of and respectful towards marginalized groups, including but not limited to LGBTQIA+ folks, racial/ethnic minorities, neurodivergent folks, people with mental illness and/or disabilities, non-native English speakers, immigrants, etc., so please do not use language that is disparaging towards such folks.

4. **Do not post NSFW content (i.e. content related to sex / drugs) outside of the NSFW section**. NSFW content is permitted (and encouraged) but is restricted to its own dedicated, role-locked section in order to protect any minors that may be on the server. Occasional low-brow jokes / innuendo are permitted, as is language of a coarse nature, but the goal is for the bulk of the server to be "**PG-13**". In accordance with this policy, please keep all of the "**R**" or "**NC-17**" content to the NSFW section.

5. **To the best of your ability, please stay on-topic**. We aim to keep the server organized by topic / interest, so please respect this by doing your part and moving conversations to the appropriate channel whenever it makes sense to do so. **In particular, conversations of a sensitive nature, e.g. describing mental health challenges or self-harm ideation, should be constrained to the appropriate channel in the sensitive content section**.

6. **Do not engage in any magickal workings on other members of the server without consent**. This includes but is not limited to energy work, readings, and spells. **We take this very seriously and will take appropriate corrective action if we receive complaints from our members**.

7. **Do not harass other server members, via direct message or otherwise**. This means that you are expected to respect the {% include atoms/roles/text.html text="!r!498208466066866186!r!" %} / {% include atoms/roles/text.html text="!r!498207388890038274!r!" %} roles, the names of which should be self-explanatory. That said, even a {% include atoms/roles/text.html text="!r!498208423524171796!r!" %} member may ask you to refrain from messaging them, in which case you are expected to honor their request or else risk facing disciplinary consequences. Furthermore, please **refrain from sending explicit content of any kind to other members in DMs without prior authorization** (this includes unsolicited sexual advances or photo / video content). This is especially important because, as previously mentioned, minors are permitted to be on the server, and virtually every jurisdiction carries heavy legal penalties for violations of statutes related to sending sexual content of / to minors.

8. **Please respect each other.** This applies in all senses of the word "respect", but in particular it means that you should **refrain from disparaging another member's beliefs**. It is acceptable (and encouraged) to share your own good / bad experiences and opinions, but please do not state or imply that your experiences are the only "real" / correct / valid ones! You may offer advice if it is requested, but unsolicited "advice" is frowned upon, as is any suggestion that a member shouldn't interact with the deities they have chosen to approach / worship. 

9. **Please respect the server staff, especially when we ask you to relocate or end a conversation that is getting out of hand** (see **Rule #7** above regarding harassment). We work hard to keep the server running in an orderly fashion, and we are here to help in any way that we can. **If you have any issues or concerns, please use the** {% include atoms/roles/text.html text="!c!complaints-grievances!c!" %} **channel or DM one of the staff**. If your issue is with a staff member, send a DM to *any other* member of the staff, who will address the issue confidentially.

{% include atoms/heading.html size="2" text="Additional Notes" %}

* Please note that some users are utilizing the PluralKit bot! It allows for other personalities, spirits, or headmates to speak without being confused for the host consciousness. You can tell the difference between PluralKit and regular server bots by checking the user roles - the server bots have a special {% include atoms/roles/text.html text="!r!497626822742376448!r!" %} role.

* Users of the PluralKit bot are entitled to the same protections as other members of the server. In other words, **bullying non-humans is just as unacceptable as bullying humans** - we welcome *everyone* on this server, humans and non-humans alike!
