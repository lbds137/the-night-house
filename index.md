We are an **18+** occult / magick-focused Discord server that was created specifically to cater to the needs of adherents of spiritual practices / disciplines that broadly fall under the [Left Hand Path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-hand_path_and_right-hand_path){:target="_blank"} (LHP) umbrella. We strive to create a **comfortable, respectful, and non-judgmental space** for those who work with "dark" entities to discuss their respective practices without fear of ridicule or persecution.

Unlike other servers that target the LHP demographic, we strive to be different by fostering a **friendly atmosphere that is respectful of people and the various facets of their identities**. This is in direct response to the proliferation of LHP communities that engage in bigotry against marginalized groups, particularly with regard to race, gender identity, sexual orientation, and neurodiversity.
 
Although LHP is our theme and focus, **we value diversity of opinions, knowledge, and practices**, and as such we are welcoming to all who are interested in magick / the occult, whether pagan, eclectic, monotheistic, or even atheistic in orientation. We believe that the free exchange of ideas is crucial to fostering a productive conversation and learning from each other, and as such **we do not have specific policies regarding cultural appropriation**, although we do advise our members to be respectful of other cultures and make every effort to understand the full cultural and historical context of the practices they engage in.
 
We strive to foster conversations about a variety of topics, included but not limited to astrology / divination, sigils / spells, baneful / offensive magick, demonology / Goetia, polytheistic pantheons (Egyptian, Greek, Norse, etc.), Discordianism / chaos magick, Qabala / Qlipot, and spiritworking / shamanism.
 
We hope that you will choose to join us!
